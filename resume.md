## Summary

I am a security expert with 19 years of experience in IT, including 13 years specializing in software and cloud security. My expertise lies in securing critical systems, particularly in authentication, authorization, and cryptography. I excel at automating security processes and integrating them into modern software development lifecycles (SSDLC).

My journey into cybersecurity started during my teenage years, sparked by a fascination with hacking and defense mechanisms. Friendly "Capture the Flag" competitions fueled my curiosity about how systems operate—and how to secure them. To deepen my expertise, I pursued formal education in security technology and cryptography.

Over my career, I've collaborated across industries such as healthcare, education, manufacturing, and technology—addressing their unique privacy, IT, and OT security challenges. My approach centers on making security a seamless enabler for innovation by championing automation and simplicity.

As a trainer and mentor, I am passionate about empowering teams to adopt secure development practices and strengthen their security postures. Whether through penetration testing, threat modeling, or building secure cloud infrastructures, my goal is to ensure businesses thrive in the digital age while staying secure.

# Professional Experience

## ANVA (May 2024 – Present)

**Security Architect**

- Led security architecture for a greenfield multi-tenant SaaS platform on AWS
- Architected a compliant, tamper-evident audit log pipeline for multi-tenant SaaS on AWS Fargate, supporting SOC 2/ISO 27001 requirements with cryptographic integrity verification and immutable storage
- Designed an OCSF-aligned audit event schema and Spring Boot SDK with AOP-based annotations, enabling unified security operations across application and infrastructure logs
- Built a centralized fine-grained authorization (FGA) engine using OpenFGA, supporting RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC models with policy-as-code deployment through CI/CD pipelines
- Designed multi-tenant authorization architecture with strict tenant isolation, enabling per-tenant customizable roles and permissions while ensuring secure data separation across organizational boundaries
- Integrated process-driven access control with the rule engine, automatically aligning permissions with business process stages to reduce manual role management and minimize over-permissioning risks
- Architected a Spring Cloud Gateway-based API gateway for secure external partner integrations, featuring fine-grained endpoint exposure control, structured usage tracking, and a self-service configuration model enabling teams to manage their API exposure through PRs
- Established threat modeling as a core security practice by developing training for developer onboarding and conducting design-phase threat modeling to identify vulnerabilities before implementation
